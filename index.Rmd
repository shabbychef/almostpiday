## Plain Old Overfitting

When backtests are fixed, you can move on to overfitting.

Overfitting has two flavors (to me):

1. Building a decent model for the assets and features used, but
overestimating future performance based on in-sample data.
(Using same data to build model and estimate it's Sharpe.)
2. Adding opportunities [decreases the expected Sharpe](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5936)
due to the added degrees of freedom.

A Quant's Kōan:

> Ignore data and your model is suboptimal.
> Use all the data: your model is
> suboptimal.

## Plain Old Overfitting

Overfit is _not_ cured by silly ML tricks:

You can talk about hold-out sets and in-sample all you want. 
_There is no out-of-sample._ There is _in-sample_ and 
_trading-real-money-on-the-strategy_.

Overfit is approached as a technical problem, but fighting
it requires discipline and soft engineering skills:
If you don't keep track of everything you have tried, you can't 
apply most techniques.

## Some Terminology

As an approximation, suppose that the returns of an asset (a strategy, stock,
ETF, whatever) are constant over time.

Typically use $\mu$ for the expected value, and $\sigma^2$ for the variance
of the returns.

Informally, the Sharpe ratio is defined as
$$
\zeta = \frac{\mu - r_0}{\sigma},
$$
where $r_0$ is the 'risk-free' or 'disastrous rate' of return.

(Formally, I tend to use 'Sharpe' to refer to a sample statistic, and
'signal-noise-ratio' to refer to population quantities. Let's not be
so pedantic here.)

## Technical Approaches

Two forms of the problem I was interested in:

1. For automated strategy search: having observed the in-sample Sharpe of $n \gg 10^4$ strategies,
possibly selected by hill-climbing in-sample Sharpe, could we de-bias the Sharpe of the optimal one? 
Or could we select some top $k$ of them and 'average' the strategies?
2. For human strategy search: having observed the _returns_ of $n \ge 10^3$ strategies, along with
the settings of some 'knobs' for each of them, could we estimate the effects of
each knob? Could we pick the best knob setting and de-bias the estimated future
Sharpe?

I suspected classical approaches (WRC and extensions, Hansen's SPA, _etc._)
would not work: different input, wrong assumptions, wouldn't scale.

### Optimal Sharpe over many correlated strategies

Suppose you observed the time series of returns of $n \gg 10^4$ strategies, each
of length $T$, in $T \times n$ matrix $X$.

Think of a dimensionality reduction, where $X$ is nearly contained in some $k$
dimensional subspace, with $k \ll T$:
$$
X \approx L W,
$$
where $L$ is $T \times k$, and $W$ is $k \times n$.

You can think of returns in $X$ as portfolios over latent returns in $L$ with
portfolio weights $W$. 

What is the maximal Sharpe over $k$ assets?

### Optimal portfolio Sharpe

Optimal Sharpe over $k$ assets is achieved by the Markowitz portfolio.
Distribution is related to Hotelling's $T^2$.

As an aside, interesting connections between quant metrics 
(the 'right' ones) and classical statistics:

 quant world  |  classical statistics  
--------------|-------------------------
Sharpe ratio                   | $t$ statistic 
squared Sharpe of Markowitz Portfolio | Hotelling $T^2$ 
expected squared Sharpe, conditional on features | Hotelling-Lawley Trace

### Optimal portfolio Sharpe

Optimal Sharpe over $k$ assets is achieved by the Markowitz portfolio.
Distribution is related to Hotelling's $T^2$.

We know the distribution of the (in-sample) Sharpe of the Markowitz portfolio
as a function of $k$, $T$, and the (population) Sharpe of the 
(population) Markowitz portfolio. 

We also have good estimators of, and confidence intervals around that population 
optimal Sharpe given the in-sample statistics. (Given in
[SharpeR](http://github.com/shabbychef/SharpeR) for example.)

Note that the $X$ did not need to be observed, only the optimal Sharpe over
$X$. (Downside: have to estimate $k$)
