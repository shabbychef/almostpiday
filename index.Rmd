## My background

* Former applied mathematician. (IUB graduate!)
* Quant Programmer & Quant Strategist 2007-2015 at 
two small hedge funds.
* Almost pure quant funds, ML-based, in U.S. ("single name") equities and
volatility futures.
* Tried many ML technologies to construct strategies: SVM, random forests, 
GP.
* Also traditional statistical approaches: plain old regression.
* Whatever the approach, we used _backtests_. (GP used them heavily.)

## Backtests

### What makes a profitable strategy?

* Need prediction of future price movements.

But also:

* Turn the predictions into trades.
* No, _really_, turn the predictions into trades.
* Eliminate or reduce exposure to certain risks.
* Control trade costs. (commissions, short financing, market impact.)

Hard to estimate the effects of the different moving parts separately.

So simulate your trading historically: A _backtest._

Backtesting basically implies quantitative strategies: you cannot backtest
discretionary trading.

## Backtests

A backtest probably should:

* simulate the effects of your actions (orders submitted).
* simulate the actions of the world (fills, commissions, corporate actions,
_etc_.).
* translate in an obvious way to a real trading strategy.
* provide an absolute guarantee of _time safety_.

Creating a good backtest environment requires:

* Software engineering: balance _time safety_, _computational efficiency_
and _developer sanity_.
* Domain knowledge and data: _How should you simulate fill?_
_How do corporate actions work?_
* Great statistical powers: _How do you interpret the results?_ _How do you
avoid overfitting?_
* Good intuition and sleuthing abilities: _What new thing is broken?_

$$
x = \sum_{0 \le i \le 100} i^2
