## My background

* Former applied mathematician. (IUB graduate!)
* Quant Programmer & Quant Strategist 2007-2015 at 
two small hedge funds.
* Almost pure quant funds, ML-based, in U.S. ("single name") equities and
volatility futures.
* Tried many ML technologies to construct strategies: SVM, random forests, 
GP.
* Also traditional statistical approaches: plain old regression.
* Whatever the approach, we used _backtests_. (GP used them heavily.)

## Backtests

### What makes a profitable strategy?

* Need prediction of future price movements.

But also:

* Turn the predictions into trades.
* No, _really_, turn the predictions into trades.
* Eliminate or reduce exposure to certain risks.
* Control trade costs. (commissions, short financing, market impact.)

Hard to estimate the effects of the different moving parts separately.

So simulate your trading historically: A _backtest._

Backtesting basically implies quantitative strategies: you cannot backtest
discretionary trading.

## Backtests

A backtest probably should:

* simulate the effects of your actions (orders submitted).
* simulate the actions of the world (fills, commissions, corporate actions,
_etc_.).
* translate in an obvious way to a real trading strategy.
* provide an absolute guarantee of _time safety_.

Creating a good backtesting environment requires:

* Software engineering: balance _time safety_, _computational efficiency_
and _developer sanity_.
* Domain knowledge and data: _How should you simulate fill?_
_How do corporate actions work?_
* Great statistical powers: _How do you interpret the results?_ _How do you
avoid overfitting?_
* Good intuition and sleuthing abilities: _What new thing is broken?_

## Different kinds of backtests

## Garbatrage

Use Bayes' Rule:

* Devising a consistently profitable trading strategy is probably hard. 
(The EMH posits that it is essentially _impossible_.)
* Bugs are easy to make. A good programmer will make several a day.

If your backtest looks profitable, what is the likelihood the
strategy is really profitable?

### An example

do three day old tweets give you this?

```{r bmzsim,echo=FALSE}
rvs <- read.csv('data/YAHOO-INDEX_DJI.csv',stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# right, most recent at top. jackasses.
rvs[,1] <- as.Date(rvs[,1])
rvs <- rvs[seq(nrow(rvs),1,by=-1),]

ac <- rvs[,ncol(rvs)]
rrs <- diff(ac,1) / ac[1:(length(ac)-1)]
pwin <- 13/15
dat <- as.Date(rvs[,1])[-1]
set.seed(12345)
wins <- 2 * rbinom(length(rrs),1,prob=pwin) - 1
rrwin <- abs(rrs) * wins
llwin <- log(1 + rrwin)
mtmwin <- exp(cumsum(llwin))
mtm <- data.frame(date=dat,mtm=mtmwin)
require(ggplot2)
ph <- ggplot(mtm,aes(x=date,y=mtm)) + geom_line() + scale_y_log10() 
print(ph)
library(SharpeR)
print(as.sr(llwin,ope=252))
```
